title: "Calamares Site Certificate Updated"
---
The expired SSL certificate for calamares.io (this website) has been replaced by a Lets Encrypt certificate. I am also setting up certbot to automatically renew the certificate -- that should have been done earlier. No systems were affected during this time, only visitors to the website.
