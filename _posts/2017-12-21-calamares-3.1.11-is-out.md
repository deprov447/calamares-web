title: "Calamares 3.1.11 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce
the immediate availability of **Calamares 3.1.11**,
an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an
advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning
operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers
without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding
and external modules support.

Calamares 3.1.11 is an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series,
continuing the every-other-week cadence established in 2017.
It fixes one newly reported issue and introduces a new module:
 - (issue) Some poorly-configured systems cannot reliably set the hardware
   clock (RTC). Previously this was an error which would abort the entire
   installation. Calamares now ignores the error.
 - (new module) It is possible to select a KDE Plasma look-and-feel theme
   from within Calamares, which will be applied to the running desktop
   (as a form of preview) and the target system. Enable the 
   **plasmalnf** module. Documentation on the module is available in
   [`plasmalnf.conf`](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/blob/master/src/modules/plasmalnf/plasmalnf.conf)

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the
[**Calamares issue tracker**](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues).
