title: "Calamares 3.2.17.1 released"
---

An embarrasing error crept into the release of Calamares 3.2.17, so here is a hotfix release:
 - *grubcfg* now works (that's the important bit, commit
   [1a13704c71dda7d2656ee12fef3f58d9603027e5](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/commit/1a13704c71dda7d2656ee12fef3f58d9603027e5) )
 - minor translation updates
 - fewer warnings from deprecated Qt methods
 - some extra logging and some simpler code

## Modules ##
 - The *grubcfg* module had a typo in it that made installations fail.
   Reported by Philip Mueller and Erik Dubois.
