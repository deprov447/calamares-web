title: "Calamares 2.4.6 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4.6**, a bug fix release that delivers improvements and fixes for recently discovered issues.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* fixed autologin handling for sddm in the displaymanager module;
* improved build system files so module linkage defaults to private;
* fixed an issue which caused the internet connection status to not be written to GlobalStorage;
* added support for building the partition module with both KPMcore 2.2 and 3.0;
* fixed a crash on startup in the webview module (if built with QtWebEngine);
* fixed an issue in the partition module which could sometimes cause the legacy bootloader to be installed on the wrong disk;
* fixed an issue in the users module to correctly disable the root password if configured to do so;
* fixed an issue in the partition module to always set the correct flags for an EFI system partition.

Notes for packagers and system integrators:

* system integrators who ship their own modified `mount.conf` should update it so it bind-mounts `/run/udev` like the upstream `mount.conf`, otherwise GRUB's os-prober instance will fail to detect existing operating systems;
* with Calamares 2.4.6 it is still possible for a user to set up encrypted `/` with unencrypted `/boot`, but such a setup is not recommended and obsolete for most use cases since GRUB supports booting from an encrypted `/boot` partition or directory;
* it is advised for system integrators who use Dracut or Debian-initramfs to test various scenarios with encrypted and unencrypted `/boot` partitions thoroughly because of the changes mentioned above.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4.6 requires KPMcore 2.2, 2.2.1 or 3.0.2. KPMcore 3.0 and 3.0.1 are not recommended due to some serious bugs which have since been fixed in 3.0.2. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).
