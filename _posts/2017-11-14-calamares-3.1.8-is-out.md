title: "Calamares 3.1.8 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.1.8**, an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Calamares 3.1.8 is an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.
It fixes one newly reported bug, one regression, and reduces code size.
- (bug) Netinstall would crash if the returned netinstall-groups data was empty.
- (regression) GeoIP data had already been read, don't read it twice.
- Use more support code from KPMCore, instead of doing it ourselves.
