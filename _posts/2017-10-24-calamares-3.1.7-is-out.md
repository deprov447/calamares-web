title: "Calamares 3.1.7 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.1.7**, an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Calamares 3.1.7 is an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.
It fixes two regressions introduced earlier in the 3.1 series (3.1.5 or before):
- Netinstall was no longer compatible with the packages module, which
  prevented any users of netinstall from installing packages from
  online repositories.
- The bootloader installation for EFI systems used the wrong name for
  the `bootx64.efi` (or `bootia32.efi`) files.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues). For a full change list, or the full list of [issues closed](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/milestone/41?closed=1) with this release, please see the Calamares code repository.
