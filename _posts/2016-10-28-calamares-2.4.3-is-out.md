---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4.3**, a bug fix release that delivers improvements and fixes for recently discovered issues.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* added support for C++/Qt batch job plugins;
* new `dummycpp` job module as an example for module developers;
* added support for early LUKS unlocking with Debian initramfs (new `initramfscfg` module);
* added support for early LUKS unlocking with Dracut (new `dracutlukscfg` module);
* multiple fixes to `/etc/crypttab` handling to improve LUKS support on Debian and related distributions;
* fixed user creation so it obeys the list of default groups for new users;
* added Deepin support to the `displaymanager` module;
* fixed an issue which could cause a failed install with LUKS if other LUKS partitions are already present.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4.3 requires KPMcore 2.2 or 2.2.1. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).
