---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.1.6**, an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.
