---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is proud to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 1.1**.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

After almost six months of intense development since the last major release, Calamares 1.1 is a product for end users. It has been carefully engineered and thoroughly tested over countless pre-release builds and three release candidates. Calamares 1.1 brings a multitude of major improvements over 1.0.
