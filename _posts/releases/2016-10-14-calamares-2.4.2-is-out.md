title: "Calamares 2.4.2 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4.2**, a bug fix release that delivers improvements and fixes for recently discovered issues.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* improved system requirements configuration checking;
* fixed case-insensitive path handling when installing GRUB on VFAT filesystems;
* removed dependency on `chfn` in the users module;
* added support for Debian-style `/etc/default/keyboard` configuration as an option;
* fixed an issue which could cause a failed install when `resolv.conf` is a broken symlink in the target rootfs;
* fixed locale filtering for UTF-8 on Fedora and related distributions;
* added support for disabling LUKS-related UI elements;
* fixed an issue in the summary page, which caused the target root partition to be mislabeled in the UI.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4.2 depends on KPMcore 2.2 or later. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).
