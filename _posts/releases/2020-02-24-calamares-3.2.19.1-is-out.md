title: "Calamares 3.2.19.1 released"
---
Whoops: the [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.19.1**, a hotfix
release that repairs some fatal regressions in Calamares 3.2.19.
Short-cycle releases are not supposed to work this way.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.

Shortly after the 3.2.19 release, distribution contributors downstream,
from [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.net/) and [Manjaro](https://www.manjaro.org/)
reported issues:
 - `/etc/hostname` not being written,
 - *udevadm* path problems (this is used after disk operations is variously
   installed in `/sbin` or `/bin` or `/usr/bin`),
 - Useless text fields showing up on the user page,
 - Initramfs hooks being set even when there is no swap.

Thanks to excellent bug-reporting from
 - Philip Mueller and others at Manjaro,
 - Walter Lapchynski and others at Lubuntu,

These problems have been resolved. Although now I look at the release,
I see I didn't put a release date in the changelog. Something for next time.
