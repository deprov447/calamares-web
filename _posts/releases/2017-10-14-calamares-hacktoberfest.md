title: "Calamares and Hacktoberfest"
---
The month may be nearly half-over, but
you can contribute to Calamares as part of
[Hacktoberfest 2017](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

<!--more-->

DigitalOcean is supporting Open Source this autumn with
Hacktoberfest; you can earn a T-shirt by contributing
to projects, like Calamares, on GitHub.
We've marked a
[bunch of issues](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahacktoberfest)
as Hacktoberfest-worthy:
generally slightly smaller improvements, of documentation,
of example code.
You're welcome to submit fixes and improvements outside of the
issues-list from Calamares, too: any pull request will do,
but remember they have to be sensible improvements,
and will be reviewed as usual.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues). For a full change list, or the full list of [issues closed](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/milestone/41?closed=1) with this release, please see the Calamares code repository.
