title: "Calamares Summer Vacation"
---
The [Calamares development team](https://calamares.io/about/)
is on summer vacation from mid-July to the beginning of August, 2018.
During this time, code updates will be minimal, releases none,
and response to newly-filed bugs may be slower than usual, or absent.

Once we're all recharged from sitting on beaches, climbing mountains,
or rafting down rivers, the Calamares team will be back at the end of
August with new releases and new features.

We wish you a good summer (or winter in the southern hemisphere).
