The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4.4**, a bug fix release that delivers improvements and fixes for recently discovered issues.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* improved EFI system partition flag management (this removes a dependency on sgdisk);
* improved parsing of SDDM configuration;
* support for selecting visible groups by default in the netinstall module;
* added option of updating the packages database before performing package operations;
* added support for try_install and try_remove entries in the packages module configuration;
* fixed potential failure in unpackfs module (caused by inability to write extended attributes to a filesystem which doesn't support them).

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4.4 requires KPMcore 2.2 or 2.2.1. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).
