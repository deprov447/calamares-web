title: "Calamares 2.2.2 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.2.2**, a maintenance release that fixes several issues which were discovered since Calamares 2.2 and 2.2.1.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* fixed a build issue with very recent (unreleased git master) KPMcore;
* fixed an issue with minimum RAM and storage requirements being ignored in some corner cases;
* improved error reporting in the unpackfs module;
* added CMake option WEBVIEW_FORCE_WEBKIT for deployers who wish to build with QtWebKit instead of QWebEngine even with Qt 5.6 or newer.

Please be advised that as of Calamares 2.2, if you are building from git master, you must initialize the libcrashreporter-qt submodule as documented in README.md. End users and packagers who use our 2.2.2 tarball are not affected.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.2.2 depends on KPMcore 2.1, with KPMcore 2.1.1 recommended for NVME devices support.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://calamares.io/bugs/).
