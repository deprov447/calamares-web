title: "Calamares 1.1.4.2 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is proud to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 1.1.4.2**, a maintenance release that fixes several issues that were discovered since 1.1.3.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

The change log for this release includes two important partitioning related fixes:

* Fixed a bug with swap partitions needlessly getting new UUIDs.
* Fixed a bug with alongside install being allowed even if the DOS MBR partition table limit of 4 primary partitions is reached.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://calamares.io/bugs/).
