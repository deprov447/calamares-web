title: "Calamares August Revival"
---
Summer is gone, and
the [Calamares development team](https://calamares.io/about/)
is working on a new release to come out later this month.
Meet some of the team at [KDE's Akademy](https://akademy.kde.org/2018)
in Vienna next week if you like.

Right now the master branch of Calamares has no really
big changes (some modules have changed, though), but there
are a number of big things lined up:
 - LVM improvements from Caio
 - Python support changes
 - Requirements checking
At present it's not decided which of these, if any, will
actually land in 3.2.2.
