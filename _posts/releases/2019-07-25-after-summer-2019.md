title: "Calamares Mid-Summer Madness!"
---
I've returned from a summer break, bicycling in France, and
it's time to pick up Calamares development again.
Starting July 29th, Calamares will be back in business,
with the current short-cycle release model being resumed.

Immediate plans are:
 - all those partitioning bugs, ugh.
 - converting some more Python modules to C++, to reduce dependencies.
 - introducing QML modules to replace PythonQt, again with fewer dependencies.
 
This will probably play out over two, possibly three releases before
the KDE Community's Akademy conference, which will take me away from
my desk again.
