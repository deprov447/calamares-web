title: "Calamares Translations"
---
As of october 2019, Calamares is translated into 54 languages.
There is a [translator's guide](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Translate-Guide)
with instructions on how it works (via Transifex, [Calamares project](https://www.transifex.com/calamares/calamares/) ).
Thirteen (13!) languages have a 100% translation, which means
that even all the obscure-ish error messages have been done.

The latest language to join the club is Malayalam,
a language of [Kerala state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala).

This language went from new to complete-except-for-the-programming-examples
in five weeks, which I think is an amazing effort by
the Malayalam translation effort.
You may notice that timezone-names are still in English: *Asia/Kolkata*,
that's some left-over i18n work that I have not spotted before.
(PR's welcome!)
The [partitioning page](/images/2019/Calamares_Malayalam_03.png)
also has some sprinkling of leftover bits of English, also names of things.

Esperanto is available if you have a sufficiently new Qt -- older
Qt versions flat-out refused to accept *eo* as a locale name,
so it could not be used.

This language is hovering around 8% complete, so it's not
usable as a native installation language, but I think it's cool
that there **is** a team working on it.

There are seven (7) languages which have 0% translation,
and one which doesn't even have any translators attached (Uzbek).
So if you want to help out Free Software with a little translation
work, and speak Catalan (in the Valencian dialect, mind),
Swiss French, Gujrati, Lao, Farsi, Urdu or Uzbek, please
reach out and ping the Calamares team on IRC, Transifex, or GitHub.
