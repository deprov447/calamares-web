title: "Calamares 2.0 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is proud to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.0**, a major release that brings countless new features and improvements over the 1.1 series. After almost five months of intense development since the last maintenance release, Calamares 2.0 is a user ready product. It has been carefully engineered and thoroughly tested over many pre-release builds.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* thoroughly rewritten partitioning feature, now based on KPMcore (the same library used by KDE Partition Manager);
* overhauled modules system, allowing for much more flexibility in configuring and arranging views and jobs;
* support for post-install mode, which turns Calamares into a first run configuration tool;
* improvements in many modules, including locale, bootloader and displaymanager.
