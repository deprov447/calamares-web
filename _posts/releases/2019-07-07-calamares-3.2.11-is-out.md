---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is .. not particularly happy to have to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.11**, a security update in
the features-and-functionality series of Calamares 3.2.x.
This is purely a security release for CVE-2019-13179 and CVE-2019-13178.
A full description is avalable at [Calamares Initramfs Weakness](/calamares-cve-2019).

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced
partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without
need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external
modules support.
