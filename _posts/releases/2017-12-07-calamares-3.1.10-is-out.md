title: "Calamares 3.1.10 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.1.10**, an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Calamares 3.1.10 is an incremental bugfix release in the 3.1 series.
It fixes one newly reported bug and introduces a related feature:
- (bug) Python job-modules could not use *pretty_name()* for reporting
  the module status when the job was started.
- The packages module can now be enabled, but then skipped if no internet
  is available (this is a preferred configuration for distro's which
  would **like** to install packages, but which are optional when there
  is no connection).

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues).
