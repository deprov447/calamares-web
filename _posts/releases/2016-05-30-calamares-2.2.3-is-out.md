title: "Calamares 2.2.3 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.2.3**, a maintenance release that fixes several issues which were discovered since Calamares 2.2.2.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* fixed an issue which caused zram devices to be included in the devices list;
* greatly improved startup time;
* fixed an issue which could cause the boot loader location choice to be reset in situations when it's preferable for the choice to be preserved;
* added support for locale choice and locale.gen configuration on Debian based systems.

Please be advised that as of Calamares 2.2, if you are building from git master, you must initialize the libcrashreporter-qt submodule as documented in README.md. End users and packagers who use our 2.2.3 tarball are not affected.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.2.3 depends on KPMcore 2.1 or later, with KPMcore 2.1.1 recommended for NVME devices support.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://calamares.io/bugs/).
