Hot on the heels of the first release candidate for the upcoming Calamares 1.1 release, the [**Calamares**](http://calamares.io) team hereby announces the immediate availability of **Calamares 1.1-RC2**.

This is a pre-release product for testers and early adopters. It brings countless improvements over 1.0 and fixes for issues that have been discovered since 1.1-RC1.

Testing is of utmost importance to ensure the quality of the final 1.1 release in a few weeks, so play with it, try to break it, and tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](http://bugs.calamares.io).
