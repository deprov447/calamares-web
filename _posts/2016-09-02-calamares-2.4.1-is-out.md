title: "Calamares 2.4.1 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4.1**, a bug fix release that solves a few issues that were discovered since the Calamares 2.4 release.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* fixed how the timezone setting is applied, so certain environments like KDE Plasma always obey the setting on first boot;
* fixed timezone selector behavior, so that a timezone changes affect the live system immediately;
* improved partition scanner code so it always excludes ISO9660 volumes (to avoid showing the live USB stick or optical disk in the devices list);
* future-proofed and optimized the codebase a bit to remove the soon to be deprecated Q_FOREACH construct and avoid deep copies of Qt containers.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4.1 depends on KPMcore 2.2 or later. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://calamares.io/bugs/).
