title: "Calamares 2.4 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.4**, a feature release that brings many incremental improvements over Calamares 2.3, as well as new features.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

The focus of the Calamares 2.4 development cycle was fixing bugs and polishing existing functionality, including locales management and partitioning, but we're also shipping an all-new package selection module.

Highlights of this release include:

* added support for reusing an existing /home partition if detected in the /etc/fstab file of an already installed operating system;
* new netinstall module which offers a choice of packages to install;
* rewritten large portions of the locale module, with new locale and timezone autodetection functionality and smarter management of locale.conf values;
* added support for an already mounted loop filesystem as source for the unpackfs operation;
* improved handling of partition colors in the partitioning interface when operating on logical partitions;
* fixed a user name validation issue which could in some specific situations cause a failed installation;
* improved defaults in several configuration files;
* improved bootloader deployment on EFI systems with an existing EFI system partition;
* countless other bug fixes.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.4 depends on KPMcore 2.2 or later. Further distribution-specific deployment adjustments may be needed for full LUKS support, for more details see [the Calamares wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/LUKS-Deployment).
