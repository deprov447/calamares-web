title: "Calamares Seeking Translators"
---
Calamares is translated into 58 languages. 59 if you count
the latest addition, *Macedonian*. However, not all the
languages have translators, so this is a call for some more
translators to sign up.

<!--more-->

Calamares uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/)
for translations. It's a nice web-based translation mechanism,
although it also supports some kinds of local tooling.
They is an Open-Source friendly, but not Open-Source.

There are 59 languages in the list for Calamares. One,
Macedonian, was recently requested but the requested has
gone away again, leaving the language orphaned.
Uzbek was similarly requested but has no translators either.

That said, there are also translations to Lao, Farsi, Gujrati, Urdu and 
Swiss French that have not seen any actual translation work done.

If you are interested in any of those languages, the
[Calamares Translators Guide](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki/Translate-Guide)
can get you started. Give me a shout on IRC, via a GitHub issue, or
a Transifex message to join.

(And as an aside, I've been asked to merge the three Spanish
translations, Spanish, Mexican and Puerto Rican .. that will
take a few active members as well to sort it out.)
