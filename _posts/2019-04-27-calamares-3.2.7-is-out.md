title: "Calamares 3.2.7 released"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is slightly ashamed to announce the
availability of **Calamares 3.2.7**, the seventh update in
the features-and-functionality series of Calamares 3.2.x.
This is a **hotfix** release.

Regressions in the (Python-based) modules *localecfg* and *initramfs* have been repaired.

## Feedback ##

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it
on the [**Calamares issue tracker**][1]. Work towards the [next release][3] continues.
