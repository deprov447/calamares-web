title: "Calamares Site and Summer"
---
The [Calamares website](https://calamares.io/) has migrated entirely
to GitHub pages. Previously it used some tiny hosting to forward
requests, but this is no longer necessary. This **does** mean that
the certificate for the site has changed, and on the 24th June at
least there were certificate warnings when accessing the site.

This is only due to the move, and there is no other issue. Once the
move is complete, the existing hosting can be switched off, which
saves a little money and a little sysadmin time.

Looking forward: it's nearly the summer of 2019. In summer, Calamares
development shuts down for about three weeks around the
[Nijmegen Vierdaagse](https://www.4daagse.nl/en/). With the
current short-cycle development model, that means we will
skip one release and get going again in August. Expect
Calamares 3.2.10 and **possibly** a 3.2.11 before the break.
