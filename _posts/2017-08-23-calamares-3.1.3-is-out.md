title: "Calamares 3.1.3 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate
availability of **Calamares 3.1.3**, a hotfix release in the 3.1 series.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations.
Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Calamares 3.1.3 is a hotfix to yesterday's Calamares 3.1.2. Calamares 3.1.2 was released without the usual -RC process, and I made some mistakes along the way. This release fixes two major, one minor, bug in yesterday's release:

* Python jobs without a pretty_name() function -- and that is the majority of them -- could no longer be run.
* The installation-is-done notification could hang Calamares when the installation failed.
* The version number in the 3.1.2 about box was still 3.1.1. For consistency's sake, the version number in the 3.1.3 about box is 3.1.2.

I apologise for the inconvenience.
