title: "Calamares 2.1 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.1**, a feature release that brings many incremental improvements over Calamares 2.0.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* partition flags support while creating or editing a partition in the manual partitioning page;
* added a check and warning when installing in EFI mode with manual partitioning without setting up a mount point and/or flag for the EFI system partition;
* fixed an issue with settings loading that wrongly defaulted to post-install mode in some cases;
* fixed a critical issue which could lead to data loss when trying to use the "Replace partition" feature on empty space;
* other miscellaneous fixes.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.1 depends on KPMcore 2.1, also released today.
