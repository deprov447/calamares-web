title: "Calamares Site Certificate"
---
The SSL certificate for calamares.io (this website) has expired. It was valid to 2017-07-16 (July 16th, 2017). Due to, well, human nature, I didn't think to renew the certificate until I was halfway up a mountain in Spain. The view is great, but connectivity not so much. The certificate-is-expired situation is expected to last no more than two weeks, but until then SSL certificate warnings will be the norm. I'd also suggest not downloading things from a site with an expired SSL certificate. Use [the Github releases page](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/releases) to obtain tarballs instead.
