title: "Calamares 2.2 is out"
---
The [Calamares team](https://calamares.io/team/) is happy to announce the immediate availability of **Calamares 2.2**, a feature release that brings many incremental improvements over Calamares 2.1.

Calamares is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules support.

Highlights of this release include:

* automated Breakpad and GDB-based crash reporting with libcrashreporter-qt;
* support for 32-bit UEFI GRUB;
* support for NVME SSDs (requires KPMcore 2.1.1);
* support for "replacing" free space;
* improvements in the debug interface (for distribution maintainers);
* miscellaneous bug fixes in the partitioning module.

Please be advised that as of Calamares 2.2, if you are building from git master, you now need to initialize the libcrashreporter-qt submodule as documented in README.md. End users and packagers who use our 2.2 tarball are not affected.

The partitioning module of Calamares 2.2 depends on KPMcore 2.1, with KPMcore 2.1.1 recommended for NVME devices support.

If you experience an issue with Calamares, please tell us all about it on the [**Calamares issue tracker**](https://calamares.io/bugs/).
